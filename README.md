 Virtual Geometry Model (VGM)
 ============================

 Virtual Geometry Model (VGM) is a geometry conversion tool, actually providing conversion between Geant4 and ROOT TGeo geometry models. Its design allows inclusion of another geometry model by implementing a single sub-module instead of writing bilateral converters for all already supported models.
